## Understanding Satoshis
Just like a rupee can be divided into 100 paise or a dollar can be divided into 100 cent, a Bitcoin can be divided into smaller units called Satoshis. In fact, one Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million Satoshis. This means you don't need to buy an entire Bitcoin to get started with cryptocurrencies. you can buy only a fraction, known as Satoshis.

To understand the division, consider the decimal system. For rupees, we have two decimal places (e.g. ₹ 1.00). For Bitcoin, there are eight decimal places. 
Here’s a visual to help:

1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis (SATs)

0.1 BTC = 10,000,000 SATs

0.01 BTC = 1,000,000 SATs

0.001 BTC = 100,000 SATs

0.0001 BTC = 10,000 SATs

0.00001 BTC = 1000 SATs

0.000001 BTC = 100 SATs

0.00000001 BTC = 1 SATs
